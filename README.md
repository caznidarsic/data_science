This repository contains a sampling of the work I did for a Master's level Data Science course. The topics of the contents include:

1. Performing Extract Transform Load (ETL) on a coffee shop dataset using SQLite.
2. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Insurance dataset.
3. Using mathematical distributions to model the "Length" variable of a Trout Length dataset, as well as a dataset containing the number of days for a software team to clear tickets.
4. Performing EDA and using mathematical distributions to model the "Rings" variable on an Abalone dataset.
5. Performing ETL, EDA and Statistical Modeling for a car MPG dataset.
6. Creating and evaluating a Linear Regression model for the MPG variable of the car dataset.
7. Machine Learning using K-Nearest Neighbors regression for the Insurance dataset, and comparing the KNN model with the Linear Regression model using Bayesian Inference.
